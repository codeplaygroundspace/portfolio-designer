      </section>
      <section className="my-grid">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          I led the redesign of Lotto Social lottery platforms, serving nearly
          45 million regular UK players. The project aimed to transform the
          traditional lottery experience into an engaging, entertainment-focused
          app.{" "}
          <strong>
            Our goal was to increase user retention and boost revenue by
            reimagining how people interact with lottery games, moving beyond
            the standard {`"buy and hope"`} approach to a more rewarding,
            gamified experience.

        <h3>Understanding the problem</h3>
        <p>
          As this project was directly linked to a key business goal, I needed
          to fully understand the project purpose and the criteria for success
          before starting any research or design work. Lotto Social aimed to
          differentiate itself in a crowded market while increasing user
          retention and revenue.
          <strong>
            {" "}
            Users were leaving the platform due to a lack of engagement between
            draws and disappointment from frequent losses.
          </strong>{" "}
          Our task was to create a more entertaining experience that kept users
          engaged regardless of winning outcomes, while still maintaining the
          excitement of potential big wins.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section className="my-grid">
        <h3>User observation</h3>
        <p>
          I conducted a user research session to observe how users interact with
          lottery products and how these fit into their weekly routines and
          social activities. From this study we discovered the following
          insights:
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-4 list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>
            üëâ Users needed more frequent engagement opportunities beyond the
            lottery draws to maintain interest.
          </li>
          <li>
            üëâ There was a strong correlation between instant gratification and
            user satisfaction
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section className="my-grid">
        <h3>Designing the solution</h3>
        <p>
          Solution design involved extensive iteration and user testing. We
          began by mapping out high-level logic on whiteboards, followed by
          creating interactive prototypes. Our team explored a wide range of
          options, particularly focusing on how to display lottery results and
          syndicate information effectively.

          Users were asked to complete a full journey, from signing up for a

          <strong>
            {" "}
            We observed their interactions with the syndicate selection process,

          The final design transformed how Lotto Social presents lottery
          participation and user engagement. The app now provides a streamlined
          and intuitive journey from syndicate selection to result checking,
          with clear social interaction options and gamification elements.The
          incorporation of daily challenges and social features has created a
          more engaging and sticky product.

  title: "Redesigning Songclip",
  overview:
    "Songclip is a SaaS platform for integrating licensed music on social and digital platforms. As the solo Product Designer, I was tasked with creating a user-friendly interface for our complex music clip integration system. My initial challenge was to design an intuitive search and integration process for +50 millions of 5-30 second music clips. I conducted extensive competitor research to understand how various platforms ‚Äì from social media to dating apps ‚Äì could seamlessly incorporate popular music snippets.",

  ],
  problemStatement:
    "Songclip was seeking to address a significant gap in the digital content market: the lack of accessible, legally compliant tools for integrating short, popular music clips into social media posts, messages, and other digital content. The business goal was clear - to create a solution that would allow platforms to easily incorporate 5-30 second meta-tagged music clips, enriching user experiences across various apps and potentially opening new revenue streams. Success would be measured by the seamless integration of our technology into partner platforms and the subsequent increase in user engagement with music-enhanced content.",

      "Integration of music clips into social and messaging platforms is not entirely new, so after understanding the requirements, I began by examining existing solutions. This investigation highlighted several key considerations:",
    considerations: [
      "üëâ How do we curate and present music clips to match user preferences?",
      "üëâ How do we ensure seamless integration across various platforms?",
      "üëâ What UI elements will feel familiar to users of TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat?",
    ],
  },
  designSolution:
    "The solution design process for Spoked involved extensive iteration and user testing. I initially created a detailed user journey map to outline key touchpoints and interactions. This was followed by developing prototypes and exploring various approaches to personalising training plans and boosting user engagement. The challenge was to distill complex training data and features into a streamlined, intuitive experience that would be accessible for both beginners and advanced cyclists.",
  webAppDesign:
    "In order to reach non-iOS users, I also designed a Progressive Web Application suitable for users on desktop and mobile.",
  thirdPartyIntegrations:
    "The Songclip API lets other platforms make music part of what's being created, shared, and send. We worked in collaboration with Viber in order to achieve a great integration between these two products.",
  userFeedback:
    "Prototypes were iterated on multiple times after remote user testing sessions. Users were asked to complete a full journey, from searching for a music clip to sharing it on social platforms. We observed their interactions with the search, preview, and sharing tools, and followed up to understand their expectations for music integration in their creative workflows.",

      "The final design transformed how Songclip presents and integrates music clips. The app now provides an intuitive search process with clear preview and editing options and seamless sharing capabilities. The design improvements simplified the user experience and addressed the complexities of copyright compliance and cross-platform compatibility.",

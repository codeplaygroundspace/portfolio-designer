- Use the latest version of nextjs.
- Use the latest version of Tailwindcss.
- Follow Frontend developer best practise.
- Do not change the copy, there is a copywriter who writes the content.
- Always define types in Typescript, use any as last resource.
- Always use `@/` path aliases for all imports in Next.js projects instead of relative paths (`../`) to maintain clean, readable, and maintainable code that follows Next.js best practices.**
Examples:
✅ **Good**: `import Header from "@/components/layout/Header"`  
❌ **Bad**: `import Header from "../../../components/layout/Header"`
